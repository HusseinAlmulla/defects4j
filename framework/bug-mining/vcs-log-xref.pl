=head1 NAME

vcs-log-xref.pl -- Parses the development history log for a project screening it with a
                      regular expression, and validates that they pass
                      a test provided by a script that can verify they are bugs (as opposed to
                      improvements, pull requests, etc.)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

vcs-log-xref.pl vcs-type -b bug-matching-perl-regexp -l commit-log -r repository -c command-to-verify

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<vcs-type> is one of C<git> or C<svn>.

C<commit-log> is the part of the development history that you wish to cross-reference with an issue tracker.
This file may be obtained for example by running C<git log>.

C<bug-matching-perl-regexp> is the perl regular expression that will match the issue (e.g., /LANG-(\d+)/mi),
and the C<repository> is the path to the git repo for this project (this argument is ignored for SVN).

C<command-to-verify> is a command to run that will verify whether a given issue ID is a bug.
The framework currently supplies two auxillary scripts (C<verify-bug-file.sh> and C<verify-bug-sf-tracker.sh>)
that help with this task. You may also supply your own.
